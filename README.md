# How to Make a Latte

## Introduction
These directions will walk through the steps of producing a simple latte.
A latte is a coffee beverage composed of espresso and milk.
While there are many steps to brewing a latte, each step is fairly simple.
However, to produce the best latte possible, each step must be performed with care.

An espresso machine, coffee grinder, and coffee beans are required.
No prior experience brewing coffee drinks is required.

## Theory
There are two components to a latte: espresso and milk.
While ice can be added to create a cold drink, we will be producing a hot latte.
This involves brewing the espresso, heating the milk, and combining the two ingredients
into a medium-sized mug.

## Warning
**An active espresso machine and its products can cause moderate to severe burns.
Please handle the espresso machine, as well as any espresso and milk products produced with extreme care.**

## Conditions Required
Prior to following these steps, have a clean, clear work area of at least 3x2 feet.
Within this work area, have the espresso machine, coffee grinder, and coffee beans ready for use.

## Steps

### 1. Preheat the Espresso Machine
**WARNING: the espresso machine can reach temperatures of 200Â°F and higher.
Please handle with care.**

With your espresso machine prepared in your workspace, turn it on and set it to heat up.
The time to preheat varies by machine, but *30 minutes* is a good guideline.

The espresso machine must reach the requisite temperature to produce
proper espresso.

### 2. Grind the Beans
While the espresso machine is heating up,
* Set the coffee grinder to grind *fine* coffee.
* Place
