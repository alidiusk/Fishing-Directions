# How to Fish

## Introduction
Fishing is a classic American pastime.
When done correctly, fishing can be a fun and relaxing activity.
Sit back and enjoy the sanctitude of nature as you learn how to fish with the steps below.

No prior experience is required.

The following materials are required:
* A spinning-variety fishing rod prepared already with a string, hook, and weight
* A small fishing bobber
* A fishing net
* Needle-nose pliers
* A container of live worms

## Theory
The goal of fishing is to safely catch and release fish while enjoying the peaceful natural environment.

## Warning
**Sharp fishing hooks can cause minor injuries or severe damage to eyes.**

## Conditions Required
Fishing is best enjoyed during sunny or cloudy weather at a comfortable temperature.

## Steps

### 1. Prepare your rod
* Ensure that your rod is prepared with a string, hook, and weight.
* Attach your bobber at the distance from the hook you want to fish at
    * For instance, at a shallow lake, this might be six feet

### 2. Apply the bait
**WARNING: Be careful while handling the hook: you could stab yourself.
The worm will squirm while you perform this step.**

* Take a worm from the container and grip it by the fleshy part near its head
* Take the hook in your other hand and stab it into the fleshy part
* String the worm up the hook

### 3. Cast the hook
**WARNING: All other persons should stay several feet away while you do this.
Maintain caution while casting: you could stab someone with the sharp hook.**

* Use one finger on your rod-holding hand to keep the line taught
* Flip open the bail (ring part of the reel)
* Carefully move the rod behind your head, then flick it forward
* Wait a few moments then shut the bail closed to stop letting out line

### 4. Wait for a bite
* Wait for a fish to bite on your hook

**NOTE**: This may take anywhere from a few minutes to a half an hour.
If no fish bite during that time span,
consider relocating to a different part of the body of water or [recasting](#3.-cast-the-hook).

### 5. Hook the fish
* Once you feel a firm tension coming from your hook, **jerk up quickly**
* If the tension dissipates, you failed to hook the fish.
    * If you have bait, continue from [Step 3](#3.-cast-the-hook).
    * Otherwise, continue from [Step 2](#2.-apply-the-bait).
* If the tension remains, continue to Step 6.

### 6. Reel in the fish
* Slowly pull your rod up while reeling in.
* Stop reeling in, lower your rod again, and continue.
* If the line feels very tight, **STOP** and wait for a few seconds. Otherwise you could break your line.

**NOTE**: This process could take several minutes or longer depending on the size of the fish.

### 7. Get the fish out of the water
* If the fish is small, it may be possible to simply lift your rod up and pull the fish onto land by the line.
* If the fish is larger, a fishing net will be required to pull the fish out of the water.

### 8. Extract the hook
* Use one hand to hold the fish by its gill.
* With your other hand, use either your hand or the needle-nose pliers to get a grip on the hook and pull it through the hole it made and out of the fish.
* The needle-nose pliers may be required if the hook is difficult to extract by hand

**NOTE**: If the fish swallowed the hook, it may be necessary to cut the line to free the fish.
You will then have to install a new hook.

### 9. Release the fish
* Hold the fish gently by the gill and place it gently into the water.
* Let go of the fish and watch it swim away.
* If you are done fishing, then clean up and head home. Otherwise, if you have bait, continue from [Step 3](#3.-cast-the-hook). If you do not, continue from [Step 2](#2.-apply-the-bait).
